# News Aggregator V2

### Description 
For this assignment you have to implement an application that aggregates news from two different APIs. The APIs you'll be using are [**Reddit**](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/ "Reddit") and [**News API**](https://newsapi.org/ "News API").

The application that you submit must have thoughtful design decisions, well documented and unit tested code. This assignment should not take more than 5 hours to complete.

### Functions
The two functionalities that need to be implemented are "list" and "search".

This is an example request for a generic GET request which should fulfill the "list".

```
> Request
GET /news   HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ
Accept: application/json

> Response
[
  {
    "headline": "Human organs can be stored for three times as long in major breakthrough for transplants",  // Headline of the article
    "link": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2019/09/09/human-organs-can-stored-three-times-long-major-breakthrough/",  // Link of the article
    "source": "reddit" // Source that you retrieved this news from
  },
  {
    "headline": "Depth of Field: The Shared Memory of One World Trade Center",
    "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/one-world-trade-center-history-future/",
    "source": "newsapi"
  },
]
```

You should also implement a feature that allows someone to "search" through the news.

```
> Request
GET /news?query=bitcoin   HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ
Accept: application/json

> Response
[
  {
    "headline": "IRS goes after cryptocurrency owners for unpaid taxes",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/own-bitcoin-irs-pursues-cryptocurrency-owners-for-unpaid-taxes/",
    "source": "reddit"
  },
  {
    "headline": "Skirting US sanctions, Cubans flock to cryptocurrency to shop online, send funds",
    "link": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/skirting-us-sanctions--cubans-flock-to-cryptocurrency-to-shop-online--send-funds-11901148",
    "source": "newsapi"
  },
]
```

*Suggestion:* Try to use /r/news for Reddit and the general category for News API (you don't have to but it's worth checking out).

### Constraints
There are some constraints that you should be aware of. Not completing any of the following constraints will stop your candidacy from moving forward:
- You must use **Python**. 
- You must use [**FastAPI**](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) for serving HTTP requests. This is to test your ability to design without the use of heavy frameworks.
- You cannot use [**PRAW**](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/v2.1.21/) for the Reddit API.
- You cannot use any database technology to aid in your development (Redis or equivilant is fine).
- You must return the three fields that are in the sample requests above in JSON format! You can add more fields if you'd like.
- You must return fields from all APIs if any exist. 
- This needs to be a running Python application on your localhost that serves an HTTP request not a console application.

### Assessment
Primarily, I will be assessing good **design decisions**. To do this, I have a hidden API that I have written that has different specifications than the ones that have been provided above. I will be integrating my own API into your news aggregator. It needs to be a simple and clear integration, the simpler the better.

Secondly, I will be assessing good **performance**. The speed of the application should not be affected by poor API speed. You need to be creative on how to solve this problem.

In addition, I will be testing the following:
- Python Proficiency
- Ability to understand and use 3rd party APIs
- Ability to parse different forms of data
- Ability to write unit tests
- Ability to write documentation
- Generally professional code that follows standards in matter of commits and security

### Submission
You should upload your code to a Github repository (private or public) and share it with me. Your repository should have a README.md that explains how to run the code and if youâ€™ve done anything extra. **If you fail to produce this repository within the time period mentioned in the email you received your application will be rejected.**

Best of luck!
